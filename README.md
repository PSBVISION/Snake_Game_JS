<h1>
  Snake Game using JS
</h1>
<h4>
The classic snake game is a simple game where you control a snake that moves around a grid, trying to eat apples and avoid hitting the walls or its own body. The snake grows longer and faster as it eats more apples, and the game ends when the snake crashes into something.
</h4>
To create the classic snake game in JavaScript, you need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the basic structure of the game, such as the canvas element where the game will be drawn, the score display, and the buttons for controlling the snake. CSS is used to style the game elements, such as the grid, the snake, the apple, and the popup. JavaScript is used to implement the game logic, such as creating the snake array, moving the snake, changing the direction, generating the apple, checking the collisions, updating the score, and restarting the game.
